# todo
Although there are tons of todo apps in the market, I found that no app can easily track the time I spent on these tasks and understand if my time management is appropriate. So I want to build like pie chart to show the time distribution on those tasks. On top of that, I hope the app can encourage and guide users to split tasks into pieces of subtasks by some hints. I believe that doing ten subtasks is more efficient than doing one huge task.
